Healthcare App

Swasthya is an all in one healthcare platform that is meant to be used by doctors and their patients alike, and is designed to assist the average user in making medical decisions. We provide 2 user experiences, one for the patient and one for the doctor.

The patient app is mainly focussed on reducing the information gap between patient and doctor. Patients are often ‘medically illiterate’, and have no information about the ailment they’re diagnosed with, or the treatment prescribed. We attempt to solve this problem with an integrated package that tries to reduce this information gap.

The doctor app is meant to be used by doctors and govt. officials to monitor the populace for the outbreak of diseases (epidemics), as well as use crowdsourced information for policy making. This can serve as an early warning system for epidemics, as well as a decision making tool.
